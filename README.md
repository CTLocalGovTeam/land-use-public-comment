**from [Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/local-government/)**

The Land Use Public Comment application is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a JavaScript application that allows the general public and other interested parties to comment on proposed land use cases being heard in their Local Government.  It provides 24/7 access to your government organization and typically supplements statutory public notice requirements. In local governments that are using technology during their planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or governing bodyâ€™s meetings, the online comments can be viewed during the hearing and at the same time residents are commenting in person on the proposal. If technology is not present, a manual report can be created and routed to appropriate staff.
